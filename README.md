## what I added for my own custom needs:
Built on top of the existing routes/endpts and added a feature where you pass the username & the API returns how many problems the user has solved today.

`/userProfile/:username/today`

Also removed rate limit, so use the URL responsibly:
`https://alfa-leetcode-api-seven.vercel.app/`

Take some time out & give some kudos to [Arghya Das](https://github.com/alfaarghya) for creating this.
